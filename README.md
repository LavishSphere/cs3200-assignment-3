## Practice SQL

### By: Ashsmith Khayrul

Queries can be found in [queries](./queries).

- Query 1: Create a new Table Music Video, that is a class of type Track (generalization) but adds the attribute Video director. A music video is a track. There cannot be a video without a track, and each track can have either no video or just one.

- Query 2: Write the queries that insert at least 10 videos, respecting the problem rules.

- Query 3:  Insert another video for the track "Voodoo", assuming that you don't know the TrackId, so your insert query should specify the TrackId directly.

- Query 4:  Write a query that lists all the tracks that have a ' in the name (e.g. Jorge Da Capadócia, o Samba De Uma Nota Só (One Note Samba)) (this is á,é,í,ó,ú)

- Query 5: Creative addition. Make an interesting query that uses a JOIN of at least two tables.

- Query 6: Creative addition. Make an interesting query that uses a GROUP statement and at least two tables.


**Bonus Points.**

- Query 7:  Write a query that lists all the customers that listen to longer-than-average tracks, excluding the tracks that are longer than 15 minutes. 

- Query 8:  Write a query that lists all the tracks that are not in one of the top 5 genres with longer duration in the database.
